- Solid overview of different reinforcement learning techniques

- It looks like I am going to use Q-Learning

* Pulling Layers
- Makes the classifier insensitive to where the object is in a picture
* Model-Based
Generally: Model-based learning attempts to model the environment then choose
the optimal policy based on it’s learned model;
* Model Free
In Model-free learning the agent relies on trial-and-error experience for
setting up the optimal policy.

** Types of Reinforcement Learning
- Reinforcment is either *model free* or *model based*
  + Model free: don't learn a model from their environment
  + Q-learning is one such model
** Vanilla Q-Learning
1. Initialize your Q-table
2. Choose an action using the Epsilon-Greedy Exploration Strategy
3. Update the Q-table using the Bellman equation

This would be the same as generating a bunch of states of the minesweeper game, taking the optimal solution (or random) for each one, and then recording the result in the table.

Minesweeper is too big of a game for this all to be stored within a single table.
*** Q-Value and Q-Table
Example Q-Table:

| State-action | Q-Value |
|--------------+---------|
| (S1,A1)      |       5 |
| (S3, A0)     |       9 |
| (S5, A1)     |       1 |

- Maps a state-action pair to a q-value
- *Q-Value*: the estimated optimal future value or the maximum expected reward an agent can reach by taking a given action A from the state S
- The Q-table is initialized to all zeros, the agent doesn't know anything about the world
- Learning about the world through trial and error is called *exploration*
- The Q-Learning Algorithm tries to learn the Q-Value for a new environment.
- Once the Q-table has been populated, action *A* can be taken to maximize the reward for a given state *S*
  + Picking the best action at a state is called *exploitation*
*** Choosing an Action
Common strategy for tackling the *exploration-exploitation tradeoff* is the *Epsilon Greedy Exploitation Strategy*

1. At evey time step when an action needs to be taken, roll the fice
2. If the dice has a probability less than epsilon, choose a random action
   a. This allows the agent to explore the environment some more
3. Otherwise take the best known action at the agent's current state


NOTE: At the beginning of the algorithm, all the actions taken are random. This helps the agent learn about the environment. As time progresses, better actions will be taken.

NOTE: All epsilon is initialized to 1 -> all aactions are random

At the end of the trainig, more exploitation will happen and less exploring.
*** Updating the Q-Table using the Bellman Equation
The *Bellman Equation* tells us how to update our Q-table after each step we take.

SUMMARY: The agents updates the current perceived value with the estimated optimal future reward which assumes that the agent takes the best current known action. In implementation, the agent will search through all actions for a particular state and choose the state-action pair with the higest corresponding Q-value

$Q(S_{t}, A_{t}) = (1 - \alpha)Q(S_{t}, A_{t}) + \alpha * (R_{t} + \lambda * max_{a}Q(S_{t+1}, a))$
- S = the state or Observation
- A = the Action the agent takes
- R = the reward from taking an action
- t = the time step
- $\alpha$ = the learning rate
- $\lambda$ = the discount factor which causes rewards to lose their value over time so more immediate rewards are valued more highly
** Deep Q-Network
*Vanilla Q-Learning:* A table maps each state-action pair to its corresponding Q-value

*Deep Q-Learning:* A Neural Network maps input states to (action, Q-Value) pairs

*** Deep Q-Network Algorithm
1. Initialize your Main and Target neural networks
2. Choose an action usint the Epsilon-Greedy Exploration Strategy
3. Update your network weights using the Bellman Equation
**** Initialize your Target and Main neural networks
A major difference between *Deep Q-Learning* and *Vanilla Q-Learning* is the implementation of the Q-table.

- Deep Q-learning uses neural network to map input states -> (action, Q-value) pairs
  + Different from a table mapping state-action pairs to a Q-value
- Deep Q-Learning uses two neural networks
  + A *main network* and a *target network*
  + These networks have the same architecure but different weights
  + Every *N* steps, weights from *main network* are copied to *target network*
  + Two networks leads to more stability and efficiency in the learning process

#+attr_html: :alt  :align left :class img
[[./images/MappingStatesToActions.png][Mapping States to Actions]]

- Main and target networks map input states to an (ation, q-value) pair
- In this case, each output node (representing an action) contains the action's q-value as a floating point number.
  + The output nodes do not represent a probability distribution, so they will not add up to 1
**** Defining our Network Architecture
From the article:
#+begin_src python
def agent(state_shape, action_shape):
    learning_rate = 0.001
    init = tf.keras.initializers.HeUniform()
    model = keras.Sequential()
    model.add(keras.layers.Dense(24, input_shape=state_shape, activation='relu',\
                                 kernel_initializer=init))
    model.add(keras.layers.Dense(12, activation='relu', kernel_initializer=init))
    model.add(keras.layers.Dense(action_shape, activation='linear',\
                                 kernel_initializer=init))
    model.compile(loss=tf.keras.losses.Huber(),\
                  optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(lr=learning_rate),\
                  metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model
#+end_src

- The main and target networks are 3 densely connect layers with Relu activation functions
  + [ ] TODO What the heck do these mean :P
- *He uniform initialization* as well as the Huber loss function to achieve better performance
  + [ ] TODO What the heck do these mean :P
**** Choose an Action using the Epsilon-Greedy Exploration Strategy
The agent chooses a random action with probability *epsilon* and exploits the best action with probability *1 - epsilon*
**** Finding Best Known Action from the Networks
- Both the *Main model* and the *Target model* map input states to output actions.
- These output actions actually represent the model's predicted Q-value
- The action that has the largest predicted Q-Value is the best known action at that state.
**** Updating Network Weights Using the Bellman Equation
$Q(S_{t}, A_{t}) = (1 - \alpha)Q(S_{t}, A_{t}) + \alpha * (R_{t} + \lambda * max_{a}Q(S_{t+1}, a))$
- S = the state or Observation
- A = the Action the agent takes
- R = the reward from taking an action
- t = the time step
- $\alpha$ = the learning rate
- $\lambda$ = the discount factor which causes rewards to lose their value over time so more immediate rewards are valued more highly


- After choosing and executing an action, the Main and Target networks need to be updated
- Deep Q-Learning agents use Experience Relay to learn about the environment and update the Main and Target networks
- *Main Network* samples and trains on a bunch of past experiences every 4 steps.
- The *main network* weights are copied to the *target* network weights every 100 steps.
**** Experience Relay
*Experience Relay* is the act of storing and replaying game states (the state, action, reward, next_state) that the RL algorithm is able to learn from.

- Experience Replay can be used in *off-policy* algorithms to learn in an offline fashion.
- Can update algorithm's parameters using information from previously taken actions.
- Used in small batches in order to avoid skewing the dataset distribution of different states, actions, and next_states that the neural network will see.
**** Bellman Equation
- The agent still needs to update the model weights according to the Bellman Equation
- We want to replicate the Temporal Difference target operation using the network instead of a Q-table
- Adjust weights and update the new q-value


Temporal Difference Target:

$(R_{t} + \lambda * max_{a}Q(S_{t+1}, a))$
*** Tips and Tricks
1. Having the right model parameter update frequency is important
   a. Updating model weights too often -> slow learning
   b. The model weuight updates every 4 steps
2. Setting the correct frequency to copy weights from the Main Network to the Target network
   a. Can lead to instability
   b. Updating every 100 steps seemed to work relatively well
3. Using the Huber loss function instead of the Mean Squared Error loss function
   a. Outliers don't influence results as much with the Huber loss function
4. Right initialization strategy is important
   a. Using the He Initialization is a good initialization strategy
   b. For networks with the Relu activation function ^
* Plan
1. [X] Create Simulation
2. [ ] Create Rewards
3. [ ] Translate a Q-table to a neural network
4. [ ] Get it to run
* Ideas
- Instead of deep q-learning I could also train a classifier for a given square.
- Honestly, creating a classifier might be the move.
- Probe the frontier
  + For every uncovered square on the frontier, grab a 3x3 centered around it
  + Have the program get trained on these 3x3 boards
-
* Frontier Probing
- [[./images/3x3/full.png][Full Board]]
- I think this is the move
- Probe all the currently uncovered NUMBER squares
  + 3x3 around the number in question
- Setup a classifier for the squares
- Flag things that have a high likelihood of being a mine


- First square is random
- Probe Frontier Algorithm
  a. Look at all the uncovered NUMBER squares
     a. A set of actions can be taken, uncovering each of the 8 adjacent squares
     b. Account for FLAGS, this can be used to minimize the number at hand
     c. Create a PDF for the action set
        a. Values between 0 and 1, 0 for SAFE, 1 for MINE
        b. A Value of 0.5 means that it has no clue.
        c. A value of 0, means that the value is SAFE
        d. A value of 1, means that the value has a MINE
  b. Take a set of actions
     a. There will be squares with action values of 0 or 1
     b. FLAG everything that should be flagged
     c. UNCOVER everything that should be uncovered
     d. Take the BEST action otherwise
  c. Repeat
** Uncovered Square Probing
*** Hashtable Implementation
[[./images/3x3/5.png][Example]] -> "  1|112|1.1"

Flip the string around so that the hash table doesn't become MASSIVE
*** Finding Squares to Probe
To save on updating, only probe squares that have had a recent change.

Batches of actions are going to be taken. So throw everything into a queue and then process everything at once


- Initialize Queue
  + Queue is a set of coordinates
  + Repeats are not allowed

1. On flag
   a. Queue surrounding squares
   b. Subtract surrounding numbers
2. On flood uncover
   a. Queue number squares
3. Regular uncover
   a. Queue current number

** Placing Mines
Recursive function that randomly places a mine if the square doesn't already have the mine.

placeMine():
    if empty:


placeMines(mines):
    currentMines = 0
    while currentMines < mines:
        if placeMine():
            currentMines++;
** First Move
Will clear mines so that a 0 is where the player clicks.

Simply count and remove the mines in the surrounding squares and then call placeMines once again.

Then the numbers for each mine will be assigned

** Numbers
Assigned after the first move by the player. This ensures that numbers are only calculated once.

Loop over squares and check surrounding squares for a mine, increment the number if there is a mine.
** Boards
- Two boards are needed
  + Keep the state of the game
  + Keep what the player can see
*** Game State Board
- Needs the following:
  + Numbers 0-8
  + Mines
*** Visible Board
- Needs the following:
  + Flag
  + Covered
  + Uncovered
*** Printing Board
Do a check on the visible board, if uncovered print the game state board
